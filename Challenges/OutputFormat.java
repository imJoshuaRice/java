/*
Every line of input will contain a String followed by an integer.
Each String will have a maximum of 10 alphabetic characters, and each integer will be in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.

In each line of output there should be two columns:
The first column contains the String and is left justified using exactly 15 characters.
The second column contains the integer, expressed in exactly 3 digits; if the original input has less than three digits, you must pad your output's leading digits with zeroes.
